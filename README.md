# NPS_API_Website
Created by Ryan Barbour for the CapitalOne Coding Challenge. 

## Technology Stack
This website was coded with plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript(ECMAScript 2015). It makes calls to the National Park Service API in order to search by park names and keywords, with state and designation filtering options. The site displays a detailed card view of each park, with links to new pages with information about the park's visitor centers, campgrounds, and learning resources. It also uses Mapbox to display live interactive maps of the parks and campgrounds. Finally, it uses icons from the National Park Service Symbol Library to indicate campground amenities.
